Pocket Radio

Arduino + Circuits Project

Goal:
Our project is focused on creating a pocket-sized radio player that captures and plays local radio signals, designed to bring the charm of traditional radio listening back into daily life. With many local radio stations now mostly accessible in older car models, this device offers a fun and nostalgic way for people to tune in anywhere, anytime. The goal is to spark renewed interest in local radio content to provide a unique, vintage-inspired gadget for music lovers, making it a practical and playful addition to anyoneâ€™s pocket. Users will be able to explore genres of music, search for their new favorite artists, and get all the information about the songs playing so they can dive deeper into the ones they love!
